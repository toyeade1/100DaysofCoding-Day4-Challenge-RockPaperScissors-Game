# 100DaysofCoding-Day4-Challenge-RockPaperScissors-Game

This game was particularly interesting to create. It involved mostly multiple if statements and looking at the solution the lesson provided, i did it in a completely different way. While that does not mean the code itsself is inaccurate, it does show a difference in problem solving. The goal was to create a rock paper sissors game where the computer would generate a random hand and based on what you selected, you would either win, draw or lose. All in all it was not too difficult to create.
